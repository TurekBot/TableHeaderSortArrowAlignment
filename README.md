# TableHeaderSortArrowAlignment
A SSCCE by kleopatra demonstrating how to put the sort arrow on the left-hand side of a TableColumn. See the following StackOverflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49121560/how-does-one-set-the-tablecolumns-sort-arrow-alignment

@kelopatra, feel free to clone and then push back to this same repo, I've made it so anyone can push back directly (I think).
